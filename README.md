<p><b>Aim and objective:</b>
The goal of the project is to use this data to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the activities performed by the study participants. To do this, we will need to pre-process the data to extract features that are relevant for distinguishing between the different activities. We can then use these features to train a machine learning model, such as a decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, or neural network. Finally, we can evaluate the performance of our model on a separate test dataset to see how well it generalizes to new examples of activities.
